## About the Project

I created this repository to gain hands-on experience in web development while combining my interest in machine learning and AI. The vision behind FreeAudioBooks is to build a platform where users can upload and convert books into audiobooks using AI-generated voices, making knowledge more accessible and convenient for everyone.

Currently, I am working on the foundational aspects of the project, focusing on basic functionality like rendering book information.

## Current Features

- **Seeding Data**: The platform is currently seeded with book titles, names, and other information, which is displayed as a template.
- **Rendering Books**: The system can render book names, titles, and information dynamically from the seeded database.

Note: There is no functionality yet for users to upload or convert books, and no practical book data has been added beyond the seeded templates.

## Future Plans

Although I am currently in the early stages of development, here are the future goals:
- **AI Integration**: Implement a text-to-speech conversion using AI to generate audio versions of books.
- **Book Upload Functionality**: Enable users to upload their own books to the platform.
- **Free Book Access**: Integrate free books available online for users to convert into audiobooks.
- **Improved UI/UX**: Enhance the design and usability of the platform for a better user experience.

## Why FreeAudioBooks?

FreeAudioBooks aims to provide a solution for users who want to learn on the go by listening to audiobooks rather than reading. It leverages AI and modern web technologies to make book consumption easier and more flexible.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Used for the frontend to display the book information.
- **Node.js/Express**: Backend for rendering data and managing book information.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing book details (currently seeded).
- **Future**: AI models for text-to-speech conversion and file handling.

This project is still under development, with many features yet to be implemented. Follow along as I continue to improve and expand FreeAudioBooks!
